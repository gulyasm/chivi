# Chivi echoing HTTP server
During debugging sometimes we need to spin up a http server and monitor the requests. I created this dead simple little server that accepts and respond to requests while writing them to the console.

**Configuration**
The port the server listens on can be set in the package.json file.

**How to start**
    
    npm install
    node start

**Contributions**

Of course. Feature requests as well.

**FAQ**

*There is no testing!?*
I know and I am ashamed. In my excuse, I do donate to rainforests.
